Place your MP3 files in this folder and update HYDRATION_TRACKS in ../script.js if needed.

Suggested filenames:
- hydration1.mp3
- hydration2.mp3
- hydration3.mp3

Notes:
- Audio will only start after you click "Start Timer" due to browser autoplay policies.
- Sirens are synthesized in-code and do not require files.
